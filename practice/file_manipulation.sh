echo "You must begin inside the directory(/home/user/practice) where your three original files are located.
 From there, you will create a dedicated folder named "backup" to store a backup copy of one file.
 If this folder does not already exist, you need to create it.
 File "a.txt" must be copied into this folder, meaning the original remains in place while a duplicate is stored separately.
 Another file, "b.txt" needs to be renamed to "b_renamed.txt" this operation modifies only the name and keeps the file in the same
 location.
 Lastly, file "c.txt" must be deleted, meaning it should no longer appear in the directory when you list the items.

Ensure the backup folder exists

Ensure the first file was correctly copied into it

Ensure the second file was renamed correctly

Ensure the third file was deleted entirely"
